        <p>
            My name is Grayson Dew, and I am a senior at SFSU. 
            I attended and transferred from Leeward Community College, on Oahu, after 6 years in the Navy working as a linguist. 
            <br><br>

            I have spent most of my programming time with C++, C#, C, Java, and a bit of Javascript. At the moment I am learning Python, Swift, and Typescript.
            <br><br>
            
            There is so much potential with this degree that I have not yet figured out what I want to do with it once I've graduated. I'm going to send an 
            application to pretty much every organization and see what offers I have.
            <br><br>
            
            I'm a sucker for escape rooms and try to do any that I come across.
