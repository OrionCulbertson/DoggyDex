          EDUCATION: <br><br>


          I am a senior at the San Francisco State University. By the end of the Fall term, I will have accomplished a Bachelor’s Degree in CSC <br><br>

          Before I continued my career at San Francisco State, I accomplished a certificate in The Humanities and a CSC Associate Degree for Transfer <br>
          at Foothill Community College, located in Los Altos CA.<br><br>

          Throughout my career, I have been exposed to compute subjects like: Operating Systems, Computer Architecture, Web Development, and <br>
          Embedded Systems (e.g. computers in cars), among others.<br><br>

          I have some experience in programing in C, C++, Java, JavaScript, and currently I am learning to code in Python and TypeScript.
