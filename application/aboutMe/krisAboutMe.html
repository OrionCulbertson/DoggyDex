            Hi there! My name is Kris P and I love dogs and machine learning. I'm in my last semester at SFSU, and I will
            graduate with a degree in Computer Science in December.
        </p>
        <p>
            My favorite breed of dog is West Highland Terrier, and I greatly look forward to taking lots of pictures of all sorts of dogs to test out the software we build in this project.
        </p>

        <p>
            My programming experence is mostly with C++ and Java, but I have developed projects with JavaScript as well. I am currently studying machine learning techniques using Python and a broad array of different libraries for Python.
        </p>

        <p>
            I hope this site serves as an educational tool that is both fun and engaging for users from all walks of life!
        </p>
